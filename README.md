# Tic_Tac_TOdin

The primary goal of this project is to build a tic-tac-toe ("noughts and crosses") game app
using vanilla js, HTML and CSS. Moreso than the actual game itself, the goal here is 
writing clean code with as little global code as possible, as specifically stated in TOP.

My outline for completing this is as follows:

-Establish a very basic HTML document with some CSS styling to accomodate the game elements. 
    ::Very simple HTML & CSS rounded square with two sections, one for the board and another for
      the other game functions (reset, etc.)

-Create the JS functionality for displaying the board, and the hard-coded HTML button elements.
    ::Initial display function created using a predetermined array.


-Add the functionality for players to select a specific spot on the board. 


-Create game-over logic, including the conditions for a tie. 


-Extend user interface to allow for player names. Add a start & restart button. 


-Add a display to congratulate winning player. 


-Optional AI computer algorithm.
